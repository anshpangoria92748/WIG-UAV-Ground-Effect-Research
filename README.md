✈️ WIG-UAV Ground-Effect Research
Ansh Pangoria

📘 Project Overview

This repository contains my complete research portfolio for a Wing-in-Ground (WIG) Effect UAV, developed as part of my final-year engineering project.
It includes:
Research Poster
Preprint (manuscript draft)
CAD model images
CFD simulation results
Experimental data (prototype build)
Final year report

Everything is organized cleanly so it can be shared with professors, researchers, and admissions committees.

📄 1. Poster

The research poster provides a visual summary of the concept, CFD analysis, and prototype.
